# PhishSleuth: A Social Engineering Risk Simulator

## 🚀 Project Overview:
PhishSleuth is a mobile app designed to simulate real-world social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, smishing, vishing) for individual users. Targeting students and non-technical users, it builds awareness through gamified phishing simulations, behavioral analysis, and instant feedback.

## 🎯 Key Features:
- **Realistic Attack Simulations**: Fake emails, SMS, and DMs tailored to user habits.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks responses to build a risk profile.
- **Instant Feedback**: Explains why the attack was fake and what users missed.
- **Weekly Challenges**: Fun "Spot the Phish" challenges with points and rewards.
- **PhishLab Mode**: Real-world phishing examples with red flags highlighted.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile development (iOS + Android).
- **Hive**: Local database for storing user behavior.
- **Firebase (Optional)**: For notifications and cloud-based leaderboards.
